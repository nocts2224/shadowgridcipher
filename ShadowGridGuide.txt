Simple Spy Inspired Cipher Guide (ShadowGrid Cipher)

This is a secret message system where letters turn into coded pairs.

Both people must share the same secret keyword.

---

STEP 1 — Pick a Secret Word 

Example:

PHANTOM

Both sender and receiver must know this word.

---

STEP 2 — Make the Letter Grid 

Write the keyword first.

Then fill the rest of the alphabet.

Remove duplicate letters.

Combine I and J.

Example:

P H A N T
O M B C D
E F G I K
L Q R S U
V W X Y Z

---

STEP 3 — Turn Letters Into Numbers 

Each letter becomes:

Row Number + Column Number

Example:

H = Row 1 Column 2 = 12
E = Row 3 Column 1 = 31
L = Row 4 Column 1 = 41

HELLO becomes:

12 31 41 41 21

---

STEP 4 — Turn Numbers Into Letters 

Use this code:

1 = K
2 = R
3 = X
4 = M
5 = Q

Example:

12 → KR
31 → XK
41 → MK

HELLO becomes:

KR XK MK MK RK

---

STEP 5 — Add Fake Codes 

Add fake pairs to confuse people.

Rule:

Every 3rd pair is fake.

Example:

KR XK ZZ MK MK AA RK

ZZ and AA are fake.

---

SENDING A MESSAGE
